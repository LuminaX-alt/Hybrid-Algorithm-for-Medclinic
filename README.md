# Hybrid-Algorithm-for-Medclinic
The Hybrid AI Algorithm in this Smart Clinic system is a central intelligent controller that dynamically routes different types of medical inputs—such as images and numerical data—to the appropriate machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) model. It acts as the brain of the Smart Clinic, enabling a seamless experience for users by automatically handling multiple disease diagnostics through a single interface.

⚙️ How It Works
The Hybrid Algorithm works in 3 main stages:

Input Detection or Selection
Users choose the diagnostic mode (e.g., diabetes, X-ray, skin cancer, etc.) via a dropdown. This removes the need for the user to know the model type or format in advance.

Dynamic Input Routing
Based on the selected mode:

If the mode requires numerical input (e.g., Diabetes Prediction), the algorithm sends the data to a classical ML model (like XGBoost or RandomForest).

If the mode requires image input (e.g., Skin Cancer Detection, X-ray Analysis), the algorithm preprocesses the image and sends it to a trained CNN model.

Model Invocation and Output Generation
The respective model is invoked to generate a prediction, which is then returned to the user in a clean and interpretable format via the Gradio UI.
📦 Supported Diagnosis Modes
The current implementation supports:

🩺 Diabetes Prediction (Numerical input → ML model)

🧴 Skin Cancer Detection (Image input → CNN model)

🫁 Chest X-ray Diagnosis (Image input → CNN model)

👁️ Eye Disease Diagnosis (Image input → CNN model)

🎨 Color Blindness Detection (Image input → CNN model)

You can extend this list to include up to 80+ diseases with minimal code changes by training or integrating additional models.
✅ Benefits of the Hybrid Approach
Feature	Description
Modularity	Each diagnostic model operates independently, so you can add, remove, or update models without affecting others.
Scalability	Easily extendable to support 80+ diseases—just add new models and link them in the dispatch logic.
Efficiency	Automatically routes the input to the right model, avoiding unnecessary computation or user confusion.
Maintainability	Central logic is easy to debug, upgrade, or migrate to cloud/edge-based deployments.
User-Friendly	Unified Gradio interface makes it easy for doctors or patients to interact with the system without needing technical expertise.
🧩 Why Use a Hybrid Algorithm in Smart Clinics?
In real-world smart clinics, patients may present diverse diagnostic data (symptoms, scans, images).

A hybrid system allows your AI to adapt to any kind of input and provide personalized, accurate diagnostics.

It integrates the strengths of different AI paradigms (e.g., ML for structured data, CNNs for unstructured images).

This approach enables real-time, multi-disease diagnostics on a single machine—critical for remote clinics, mobile units, or telemedicine platforms.

📌 Tips for Developers
Place all models inside a models/ directory.

Load models once at the start to reduce latency.

Use modular functions for preprocessing and prediction.

Use gr.Blocks if you want a more interactive interface.
Currently we are in development mode
